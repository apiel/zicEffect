# TODO

- FIXME click filter when switching between LPF to HPF
- TODO randomly change pitch... ?? (using pitchbend?)
- TODO Use the granular synth and combine it with random sample player features...

       Need a synth to randomly pick up a sample (giving possibilities to pick next random sample (keep order so we can come back to previous one) or let automatically the sequencer pickup and play a sample randomly every random sec) where we can then apply some granular effect on top of it...
- TODO ? use lv2 plugin
